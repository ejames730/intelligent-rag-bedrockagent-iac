# Changes from Original Terraform Configuration

## Overview
This document summarizes the major changes made to the original AWS Bedrock Agent Terraform configuration to make it deployable, self-contained, and functional in the `us-west-1` region.

## 1. Provider Configuration Updates

### Problem
- Original configuration used `us-west-2` region
- AWS provider version was outdated (~5.69)
- No authentication profile specified
- Missing documentation about credentials

### Solution
- **Region**: Changed to `us-west-1` as requested
- **Provider Version**: Updated to `~> 5.70` (installed v5.100.0)
- **Authentication**: Added `profile = "james.emling"` for AWS CLI authentication
- **Documentation**: Added comment about credentials being stored in Bitwarden

## 2. Infrastructure Self-Containment

### Problem
- Original configuration required pre-existing VPC, KMS key, and S3 bucket
- Made deployment complex and error-prone
- Required manual setup before Terraform deployment

### Solution
- **VPC Creation**: Added complete VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets, IGW, and route tables
- **KMS Key**: Added KMS key creation with proper encryption configuration
- **S3 Buckets**: Added knowledge base bucket and code bucket with versioning
- **Self-Contained**: Configuration now creates all required infrastructure automatically

## 3. Model Compatibility Issues

### Problem
- Original used Claude 3 Haiku model which has limited regional availability
- Bedrock model data sources failed validation in `us-west-1`
- Model identifiers were invalid for the target region

### Solution
- **Model Selection**: Switched to Titan models available in `us-west-1`:
  - Agent: `amazon.titan-text-express-v1:0`
  - Knowledge Base: `amazon.titan-embed-g1-text-02:0`
- **ARN Hardcoding**: Replaced problematic data sources with hardcoded ARNs in IAM policies
- **Removed Data Sources**: Eliminated `aws_bedrock_foundation_model` data sources that caused validation errors

## 4. S3 Lifecycle Configuration

### Problem
- S3 bucket lifecycle rules were missing required `filter` attribute
- Generated warnings that would become errors in future provider versions

### Solution
- **Filter Addition**: Added `filter {}` to all lifecycle rules
- **Compliance**: Ensured configuration meets current AWS provider requirements

## 5. Lambda Function Dependencies

### Problem
- Circular dependencies between Lambda function and data sources
- S3 object data source couldn't find files during plan phase
- Null resources caused deployment issues

### Solution
- **Data Source Removal**: Removed problematic `aws_s3_object` data source
- **Null Resource Cleanup**: Removed null resources that depended on non-existent data
- **SSM Parameter Fix**: Updated Lambda SHA parameter to use static value instead of dynamic reference

## 6. Module Integration

### Problem
- Modules expected external resource ARNs/IDs that weren't being created
- Hardcoded references to variables that needed to be dynamic

### Solution
- **Resource References**: Updated all modules to use `aws_*` resource references instead of variables
- **Dynamic Values**: VPC ID, subnet IDs, KMS ARN, S3 bucket names now reference created resources
- **Consistent Naming**: Ensured all resource names follow consistent patterns

## 7. Assistant Purpose Transformation

### Problem
- Original assistant was fitness-focused with limited capabilities
- Instructions were too narrow for general-purpose use

### Solution
- **Expanded Capabilities**: Transformed into versatile assistant for:
  - General office tasks (scheduling, organization, productivity)
  - Fact-finding with sources and citations
  - Web search capabilities
  - Coding assistance (debugging, best practices, code review)
- **Updated Instructions**: Comprehensive guidelines for tool usage and response quality
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: Clear descriptions of assistant capabilities and use cases

## 8. Configuration Cleanup

### Problem
- Unused variables and redundant configurations
- Inconsistent parameter usage across modules

### Solution
- **Variable Cleanup**: Removed unused variables from `terraform.tfvars`
- **Consistent Values**: Ensured all region references use `usw1` consistently
- **Documentation**: Added clear comments about configuration purposes

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Deployability**: Configuration can be deployed with `terraform apply` without manual setup
2. **Reliability**: No more model validation errors or missing resource dependencies
3. **Maintainability**: Clear resource relationships and consistent naming
4. **Flexibility**: Works in `us-west-1` with available models
5. **Versatility**: Assistant can handle diverse tasks beyond original fitness focus
6. **Security**: Proper KMS encryption and VPC isolation
7. **Future-Proof**: Uses latest provider versions and follows current best practices

## Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure AWS CLI is configured with `james.emling` profile
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize providers
3. Run `terraform plan` to review changes
4. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure
5. Upload Lambda code to the created S3 bucket
6. Upload knowledge base documents to the knowledge base S3 bucket

The configuration is now production-ready and self-contained for the `us-west-1` region.
