## Data Privacy & Security Policies

### AWS Bedrock's Data Protection Commitments

#### üîí Data Isolation & No Third-Party Sharing
- **Policy**: Customer data processed through Bedrock is NOT shared with model providers (Anthropic, etc.)
- **Implementation**: All data processing occurs within customer's AWS account
- **Guarantee**: Data remains isolated and is not used for other customers' model training

#### üö´ No Model Training with Customer Data
- **AWS Policy**: "AWS does not use customer data to train its foundation models"
- **Architecture**: Customer inputs/outputs are not used for model improvement
- **Contract**: Explicitly stated in AWS Enterprise Agreement terms

#### üõ°Ô∏è Enterprise Security Features

**Encryption:**
- End-to-end encryption in transit and at rest
- Customer-managed KMS keys (implemented in our solution)
- TLS 1.2+ for all communications

**Access Control:**
- AWS IAM integration for granular permissions
- VPC endpoints for private network access
- CloudTrail audit logging for all activities

**Compliance Certifications:**
- ‚úÖ SOC 1, 2, 3
- ‚úÖ PCI DSS
- ‚úÖ HIPAA Eligible
- ‚úÖ GDPR Compliant
- ‚úÖ FedRAMP Authorized

### Data Usage Policies

**Logging:**
- AWS may log metadata for service improvement (not content)
- CloudWatch logging can be disabled if desired
- All logs remain within customer's AWS account

**Data Retention:**
- No retention of customer conversation data
- Temporary processing data automatically deleted
- Customer controls data lifecycle
